<h3>Notes</h3>
<h4>Shell Inheritance</h4>
<p>
  All wrapping components inherit from
  <i>lib/helpers/dds.component.ts</i>; This base component includes default
  inputs such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    elementId (optional) - If left unsupplied, a random ID will be used instead.
    This is applied to the base element of the DDS component and similar IDs are
    generated for all linked/child components.
  </li>
  <li>
    init: "now" | "later" | "manual" = "now"; Instructs the shell component to
    initialize during AfterViewInit (now), or at some point via mutationObserver
    (later), or manually from the parent component (manual) by calling its
    method, initializeNow()
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="boxH4">Initialization Timing</h4>
<p>
  The component shell normally initializes the DDS component within the
  AfterViewInit life cycle stage. However if you add the
  <i>init</i> property to any of the components' instances, it will initialize
  AFTER that step, whenever the DDS component is found in the DOM.
</p>
